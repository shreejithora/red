			a)For the people who are willing but don't have time to go till the clothes bank.
			b)Number of clothes bank are very  far being just a few (3 places in the kathmandu valley and just a total of six in the whole country)
			c)Not feasible to go till the clothes bank carrying that heavy loads of clothes.
			d)Because its just a click away.
